# TalkSpace 🚀
### Real-Time Chat, Video Conferencing & Screen Sharing Platform

TalkSpace is a full-stack real-time communication platform that provides instant messaging, video conferencing, audio calling, and live screen sharing. The application is built using modern web technologies to deliver low-latency, secure, and seamless real-time communication.

This project demonstrates real-world implementation of WebRTC, Socket.io, and scalable full-stack architecture, making it suitable for learning, final-year projects, and production-ready systems.

## Overview

Modern applications require more than simple text-based messaging. Users expect real-time chat, video meetings, and screen sharing within a single platform.

TalkSpace integrates:
- Real-time chat
- Video & audio calling
- Live screen sharing
- Secure authentication
- Responsive UI

All communication happens without page refresh, ensuring a smooth and interactive experience.

---

## Problem Statement

Traditional communication systems suffer from high latency, lack of real-time updates, and dependency on multiple tools for chat and video meetings.

TalkSpace solves these problems by combining real-time messaging, video conferencing, and screen sharing into a single, unified platform using WebSockets and peer-to-peer communication.

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository  
git clone https://github.com/Rakeshivam/TalkSpace.git

cd TalkSpace
2. Install backend dependencies  

npm install
3. Install frontend dependencies  

cd client
npm install

4. Run the application  
npm run dev


Backend runs on: http://localhost:5000  
Frontend runs on: http://localhost:3000

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key


---

## Working Methodology

1. User registers or logs in
2. Backend authenticates the user
3. Socket.io establishes real-time connection
4. WebRTC signaling handled via Socket.io
5. Peer-to-peer video/audio connection established
6. Screen sharing stream transmitted in real-time
7. Chat messages delivered instantly

## Future Enhancements

- Group video conferencing
- File sharing during calls
- Push notifications
- End-to-end encryption
- Dark mode
- Mobile application
